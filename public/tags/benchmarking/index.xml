      <description>The speed and performance analyzes that are performed to see how fast the function you are writing or to find the faster one between the two functions is called benchmark tests. (In fact, benchmarking is called any kind of measurement and comparison process.) In this article, weâ€™ll cover a few ways we can do a benchmark test in R.
