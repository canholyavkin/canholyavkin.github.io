      <description>In 2018, Craig Venter and his team in Human Longevity Inc. published a remarkable article titled “Identification of Misclassified ClinVar Variants via Disease Population Prevalence”.1 The article was about excess genetic risk and misclassification in the ClinVar database. They observed that inflation increases as the level of evidence supporting the pathogenic nature of the variant decreases. In other words, variants that have fewer interpretation records were more prone to be misclassified as pathogenic.</description>

Unfortunately, finding such comprehensive and tidy data is not always easy. For this reason, I decided to start the ”Data Sources” series, which will introduce interesting datasets that you can access on the web.</description>
