      <description>Dealing with R as a professional or hobby; you always need a good dataset to get started. The more comprehensive and interesting the dataset is, the more creative visuals and interesting statistical findings will be created. Unfortunately, finding such comprehensive and tidy data is not always easy. For this reason, I decided to start the ”Data Sources” series, which will introduce interesting datasets that you can access on the web.</description>

      <description>The speed and performance analyzes that are performed to see how fast the function you are writing or to find the faster one between the two functions is called benchmark tests. (In fact, benchmarking is called any kind of measurement and comparison process.) In this article, we’ll cover a few ways we can do a benchmark test in R.
At this point, you may want to consider why you need a performance test.</description>
