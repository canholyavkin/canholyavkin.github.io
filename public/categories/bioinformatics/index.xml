      <description>As of May 2020, a total of 61 high coverage SARS-CoV-2 sequences were submitted to Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from Turkey. In this post, I’ll share an overview about the mutations and phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Turkey. Prior to analysis, all sequences were downloaded from GISAID and multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT v7.450 tool.1 The phylogenetic tree was constructed using Phylip v.</description>

      <description>In 2018, Craig Venter and his team in Human Longevity Inc. published a remarkable article titled “Identification of Misclassified ClinVar Variants via Disease Population Prevalence”.1 The article was about excess genetic risk and misclassification in the ClinVar database. They observed that inflation increases as the level of evidence supporting the pathogenic nature of the variant decreases. In other words, variants that have fewer interpretation records were more prone to be misclassified as pathogenic.</description>
