      <description>Dealing with R as a professional or hobby; you always need a good dataset to get started. The more comprehensive and interesting the dataset is, the more creative visuals and interesting statistical findings will be created. Unfortunately, finding such comprehensive and tidy data is not always easy. For this reason, I decided to start the ”Data Sources” series, which will introduce interesting datasets that you can access on the web.</description>
